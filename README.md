# ML_Modeling_Intro

Explore different mathematical models in machine learning, like linear, logistic, SVM, etc.
Use common datasets, like CMNIST. Code while following online tutorials. Slightly modified some code to fit my system.

# Setup (Windows)
1. Create a directory for python projects (recommended)
2. Check python version, add to path variable
3. Install pip and upgrade pip
4. Use pip to install tensorflow, and any other missing packages
5. Create virtual environment (venv)
6. Activate venv (If have trouble with permissions, type 'Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned' in powershell with administration privileges
7. Run python scripts in virtual environment
8. Deactivate virtual environment when done
9. Use the command 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted' in order to restrict privileges after finishing

Note: Sometimes, a message saying that a GPU is needed may show up, but can ignore messages with Information and Warning Tags
